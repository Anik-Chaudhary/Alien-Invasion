# Alien Invasion

Alien Invasion is a classic arcade-style game developed with Python and Pygame, inspired by the vintage Space Invaders gameplay. Control your spaceship, dodge and shoot waves of incoming aliens, and aim for the highest score!

## Game Features

- **Smooth Controls:** Move your ship left or right and fire bullets to destroy alien fleets.
- **Dynamic Levels:** The game speeds up and aliens become more valuable as you progress through levels.
- **Scorekeeping:** Earn points for each alien destroyed. Track your current and highest scores.
- **Life System:** Lose a ship if an alien hits you or reaches the bottom. The game ends when you run out of ships.
- **Fullscreen Experience:** The game automatically adjusts to your screen size.
- **User Interface:** A Play button lets you start or restart the action.
